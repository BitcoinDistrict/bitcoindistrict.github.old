Bitcoin District's very first Book Club is kicking off its first reading with **The Blocksize War by Jonathan Bier**.  

The Blocksize War, roughly between 2015 and 2017, was a heated debate within the Bitcoin community about the size limit of blocks on the blockchain.  

Big Blockers argued for increasing the size to handle more transactions, lowering fees, and making Bitcoin more scalable for everyday use.
Small Blockers favored keeping the limit small to prioritize security and decentralization. They worried large blocks would be too expensive for individual users to run a Bitcoin node, potentially centralizing the network.  

The fight went beyond block size, sparking questions about who controls Bitcoin's core protocol. It was a pivotal moment in Bitcoin's history, and its effects are still felt today.
