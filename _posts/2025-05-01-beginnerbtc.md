**Curious about Bitcoin but not sure where to begin?**

Join us in the heart of DC for a fun, beginner-friendly Bitcoin session hosted at Compass Coffee.

Inspired by the grassroots energy of communities like My First Bitcoin, we’re bringing the same spirit to Washington, DC—right here in our growing local Bitcoin scene.

If you're new to Bitcoin or just introducing a friend or family member to the space, this one-hour session is designed to help you get comfortable with the basics in a welcoming, non-technical environment. ☕⚡

### What to Expect:

A relaxed and supportive vibe  
Clear, simple explanations of Bitcoin fundamentals  
Engaging conversation and Q&A  
Great coffee and even better company  

📍 Location: Compass Coffee – 1703 H St NW, Washington, DC  
🕕 Time: We’ll kick off right at 6:00 PM, so come a little early to grab a drink and settle in.  
👥 Space is limited to 30 participants for a more personal experience.  

### A few community guidelines to keep things flowing:

✅ This meetup is *100% focused on Bitcoin* - nothing else.  
✅ Respect everyone’s privacy: **No photos unless everyone in the frame is cool with it**.  
✅ Keep side conversations to a minimum during group discussion so everyone can hear and be heard.  
✅ Be kind, be curious, and clean up after yourself—let’s keep Compass Coffee happy to host us again. 🙌
