**Bitcoin District** is a community of Bitcoiners living & working in the greater DMV metro area. Join us for a "Coffee & Bitcoin" meetup where we'll talk about what's happening in the world of Bitcoin.

We highly encourage anyone who is new to Bitcoin or just a little curious to come and ask questions.. don't be shy!

**Our events are Bitcoin focused and we generally avoid discussing other coins & tokens. Nothing discussed during this meetup is financial advice. Always do your own research.**
