With first-hand reporting and fresh analysis that illustrates the vast, often unappreciated power that the Treasury Department wields at home and abroad, **Paper Soldiers** tells the inside story of how we really got here‚Äîand the future not only of the almighty dollar, but the nation‚Äôs teetering role as a democratic superpower.  

**UPDATE** We also have the pleasure of having Scott & Tali from Free Market Kids join us for a round of their Bitcoin mining board game HODL UP right after we finish discussing our book!
