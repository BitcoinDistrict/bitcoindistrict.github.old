BitcoinDay is a localized, single-day, fast & focused Bitcoin-only gathering that aims to maximize signal and connectivity, and minimize echo and noise. It is designed to facilitate connections between Bitcoin influencers and plebs. We attract high-caliber, expert speakers to spend the day with us and interact with participants both on and off the stage. We work to maintain a local, small gathering environment where everyone has a chance to interact with each other. Our goal is to facitate connections that will last a lifetime and inspire positive action that accelerates the transition to a Bitcoin economy.
