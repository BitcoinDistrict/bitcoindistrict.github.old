This is THE ACTIVITY that combines Hal Finney's love of running and Bitcoin and is raising funds and awareness to help cure ALS! Join your fellow DMV Bitcoiners as we walk/crawl/run/roll around the National Mall in honor of Hal.

Runners, joggers and walkers of all ages are welcome! We will walk around the National mall and meet at a rally point in front of the Capitol to take an [optional] group photo. Wear ORANGE if you have it!
