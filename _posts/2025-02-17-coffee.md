Bitcoin District is a community of Bitcoiners living & working in the greater DMV metro area. Join us for a "Coffee & Bitcoin" meetup where we'll talk about what's happening in the world of Bitcoin.

We highly encourage anyone who is new to Bitcoin or just a little curious to come and ask questions.. don't be shy!

Is Bitcoin a Smart Savings Strategy or a Risky Investment?Is holding Bitcoin a long-term savings strategy like digital gold, or is it a high-risk investment with uncertain returns? Join us as we discuss Bitcoinâ€™s role in wealth preservation, portfolio growth, and the risks and rewards of holding Bitcoin in todayâ€™s changing financial landscape.
