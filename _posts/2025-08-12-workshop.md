Join Bitcoin District for an educational workshop focused on one of Bitcoin's most important principles: "Not your keys, not your Bitcoin."

This hands-on workshop is perfect for both beginners who want to learn the fundamentals of Bitcoin self-custody and more experienced users looking to level up their security practices.

## What We'll Cover:

### üîê Self-Custody Fundamentals
- Understanding the difference between custodial and non-custodial Bitcoin storage
- Why self-custody matters for your financial sovereignty
- Common mistakes to avoid when managing your own Bitcoin  

### üõ†Ô∏è Hardware & Software Wallets
- Comparing different wallet types and their security trade-offs
- Live demonstration of setting up a hardware wallet
- Best practices for wallet backup and recovery  

### üîë Private Key Management
- Understanding seed phrases and how they work
- Understanding entropy and why it's critical to seed generation
- Secure storage methods for your recovery information
- Creating redundant backups without compromising security  

## Who Should Attend:
- New Bitcoiners ready to take control of their Bitcoin
- Anyone currently using exchange wallets who wants to learn about alternatives
- Experienced users looking to improve their security setup

We highly encourage anyone who is new to Bitcoin or just a little curious to come and ask questions... don't be shy! This is a judgment-free learning environment where we support each other in understanding Bitcoin's technical aspects.  

Note: We'll be doing live demonstrations, but this is an educational workshop only. Any hardware wallet purchases or setup decisions are entirely your own. Nothing discussed during this workshop is financial advice. Always do your own research.  

## Getting There:
üöá Metro: Rosslyn Station via the Blue, Orange or Silver lines  
üöó Parking: There are several parking garages in the area as well as many spots along the streets. Remember to check signage.  

Our events are Bitcoin focused and we generally avoid discussing other coins & tokens. There are plenty of other Meetups to discuss other cryptos and blockchains.
