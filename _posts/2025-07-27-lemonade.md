Join us for a fun, community meetup to support Asher, a 6-year-old "kidpreneur" behind District Lemonade! He launched his fresh-squeezed lemonade company in the summer of 2024. When he's not busy with his business, Asher loves playing with magnetic blocks, building LEGO, traveling, track & field and learning about wildlife. With dreams of becoming an architect and developer, he's already started investing. Asher lives with mom and dad, his sister, Amaris, and brother, Ean. The family often helps out at the stand on the weekends.

District Lemonade recently started accepting Bitcoin payments over lightning so if you've been itching to get out there and spend some sats, what better way than to support a young entrepeneur?

We'll be there around 11:30 to socialize and take a group photo (participation optional) but feel free to swing by any time between 10:30AM and 4:00PM for lemonade.

Location: Dupont Circle (inside the circle) in Washington DC

‚òëÔ∏è Use your Bitcoin Lightning wallet to pay for a delicious & refreshing glass of lemonade.  
‚òëÔ∏è Meet & connect with other Bitcoiners in the community.  
‚òëÔ∏è Take a cool photo transacting with Bitcoin while merchant adoption is still so early.
