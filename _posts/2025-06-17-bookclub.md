Join the Bitcoin District Book Club! We meet every month to explore new and exciting rabbit holes by reading books that are popular with bitcoiners.  

Join us as we discuss The Big Print by Lawrence Lepard, a timely critique of America's monetary system and a call for a return to sound money. Lepard explores how the abandonment of the gold standard in 1971 triggered inflation, rising debt, and wealth inequality, driven by relentless money printing and misguided Federal Reserve policies. In this thought-provoking read, he outlines how assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin could restore financial stability and protect against future crises. The book challenges readers to understand the roots of economic dysfunction and consider real solutions for change.
