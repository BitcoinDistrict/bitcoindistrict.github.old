The global financial landscape is rapidly evolving. National leaders in the U.S. and worldwide are engaging with Bitcoin for the first time as a strategic asset. At this pivotal moment, the Bitcoin for America Forum will bring together executives from traditional finance and the digital asset industry, as well as senior policymakers and thought leaders, to set the course for America‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy.  

Organized by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, this invitation-only forum will take place on the morning of March 11, 2025, in Washington, DC. Our objective is to demonstrate broad agreement that expanding Bitcoin as a national asset would accrue strategic benefits to the U.S. and foster a dialogue that informs executive and legislative action.   

Forum sessions will detail Bitcoin‚Äôs role in a changing world order, how Bitcoin aligns with U.S. strategic interests, why the U.S. could consider diversifying its assets into bitcoin, and how it could execute a national Bitcoin strategy.   

Select sessions will be live-streamed for the public, though the forum will be closed to the press.
