Join us for an after work happy hour at Patsy's American where we'll talk about what's happening in the world of Bitcoin. We'll be in the back bar area, look for the Bitcoin gear.

üëÄ Find us in the back bar
üç∫ Order at the bar and grab a seat!

We highly encourage anyone who is new to Bitcoin or just a little curious to come and ask questions... don't be shy!

**Our events are Bitcoin focused and we generally avoid discussing other coins & tokens. Nothing discussed during this meetup is financial advice. Always do your own research.**
