Washington, DC is home to the annual Blossom Kite Festival on the National Mall during the famous Cherry Blossom Festival. Bring a kite to fly or just come hang out with other DMV Bitcoiners. Trey will be flying a big, beautiful twin-tail #StudyBitcoin kite (see the event pic) to help raise awareness so if you can’t find us, just LOOK UP for the big orange Bitcoin logo! We plan to meet somewhere in the grassy area between the German-American Friendship Garden and the Washington Monument but in case we move around a bit or you can’t find us, just message the Meetup group.

Feel free to bring the whole family and make it a picnic with a blanket/chairs and some snacks!
