Join the Bitcoin District Book Club! We meet every month to explore new and exciting rabbit holes by reading books that are popular with bitcoiners.

"Salt: A World History" by Mark Kurlansky is a captivating journey through the profound impact of salt on human civilization. From its crucial role in food preservation to its influence on trade routes, economies, and even wars, salt has been a cornerstone of human progress. Kurlanskyâ€™s engaging narrative uncovers how this humble mineral shaped cultures, languages, and political landscapes across the globe. For Bitcoiners, this book offers a compelling parallel: just as salt was once a vital, scarce commodity that disrupted traditional systems of value and power, Bitcoin now challenges modern financial structures with its decentralized nature.
