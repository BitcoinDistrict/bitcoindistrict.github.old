**The Ethics of Money Production by Jörg Guido Hülsmann** argues against the government's monopoly on money production. Hülsmann contends that money should be a privately produced good, like any other commodity. He challenges the assumption that government control is necessary for monetary stability, arguing that private competition would lead to a more stable and ethical monetary system. The book delves into the history of money and explores the economic and ethical implications of government intervention, advocating for a return to a free market in money.
