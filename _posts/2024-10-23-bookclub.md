**The Sovereign Individual by James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg** is a provocative exploration of the changing global landscape and its implications for individual sovereignty. The authors argue that the world is undergoing a shift from a centralized, nation-state-dominated order to a more decentralized, individual-centric one. This transformation is driven by factors like technological advancements, globalization, and the decline of traditional institutions. As a result, individuals are becoming increasingly empowered to manage their own affairs, bypassing traditional authorities and institutions. Davidson and Rees-Mogg contend that this new era will favor those who can adapt and thrive in a more chaotic and competitive environment.
