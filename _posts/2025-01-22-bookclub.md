**The Creature from Jekyll Island by G. Edward Griffin** unveils the secretive origins and controversial workings of the Federal Reserve System, portraying it as a private banking cartel established to serve the interests of financial elites rather than the public. Griffin traces its creation to a clandestine 1910 meeting on Jekyll Island, Georgia, and argues that the Federal Reserve enables economic manipulation, inflation, and perpetual debt cycles. Combining history, economics, and a critique of centralized banking, the book challenges mainstream narratives and invites readers to question the true purpose and consequences of the Federal Reserve in shaping global financial systems.
