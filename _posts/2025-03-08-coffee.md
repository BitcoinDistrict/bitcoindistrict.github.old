**Bitcoin District** is a community of Bitcoiners living & working in the greater DMV metro area. Join us for a "Coffee & Bitcoin" meetup where we'll talk about what's happening in the world of Bitcoin.

We highly encourage anyone who is new to Bitcoin or just a little curious to come and ask questions.. don't be shy!

Is Bitcoin a Smart Savings Strategy or a Risky Investment?Is holding Bitcoin a long-term savings strategy like digital gold, or is it a high-risk investment with uncertain returns? Join us as we discuss Bitcoin’s role in wealth preservation, portfolio growth, and the risks and rewards of holding Bitcoin in today’s changing financial landscape.

Be sure to check out the special Bitcoin Blend, an El Salvador single-origin roast from our host Compass Coffee. You can order from [their website](https://www.compasscoffee.com/products/bitcoin-blend) and you can even pay in Bitcoin!  

**Our events are Bitcoin focused and we generally avoid discussing other coins & tokens. Nothing discussed during this meetup is financial advice. Always do your own research.**
