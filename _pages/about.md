Bitcoin District is a network of Bitcoiners who live and work around the greater DC, Maryland and Virginia (DMV) metro area.​

Most importantly, we're a group of people from all walks of life brought together by the common belief that Bitcoin can help make the world a better place.

We're not a lobby, a company, an institute, a foundation, a building or a coworking space​.

The Bitcoin District website and any social media accounts are tools to help communicate public events organized by local Bitcoiners.
