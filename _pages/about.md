Bitcoin District is a network of Bitcoiners who live and work around the greater DC, Maryland and Virginia (DMV) metro area.​

Most importantly, we're a group of people from all walks of life brought together by the common belief that Bitcoin can help make the world a better place.

We're not a lobby, a company, an institute, a foundation, a building or a coworking space​.

The Bitcoin District website and any social media accounts are tools to help communicate public events organized by local Bitcoiners.

While the Bitcoin District site is centrally managed by volunteers, the Bitcoiners who make up the community are very much decentralized.

If you're a Bitcoiner in the DMV and want to get involved, come to an event or send us an email and we'll introduce you to your Bitcoiner neighbors.
